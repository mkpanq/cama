# üê∂ Cama - "Control All My Assets" Personal Finance App

### Background
I decided to move with this project for several reasons:
1. To maintain complete control over my financial life and transactions.
2. No other open-source software projects perfectly met all of my needs.
3. Aiming to create a larger project in my portfolio that I use daily and can develop simultaneously.

### Current development
For now I do not have any timeline or roadmap for the initital version - will probably try to figure something out when I release first alpha (?) or other very-early version.

#### Note:
I‚Äôm aware the code is a bit messy. A lot of it was written on the fly without a clear plan, so things might look a bit chaotic for now. Most of the fixes and cleanups I have in mind are listed in the TODO.md file, but yeah‚Äîthere‚Äôs definitely more to refactor.

#### TODO.md
[Here](TODO.md) is a list of things I need to do before the first alpha release - if you want to help me with it, go ahead!

### Technicals
The current stack (which obviously can be changed in future) includes:
- TypeScript
- NextJS (v15)
- DrizzleORM for database operations
- GoCardless Bank Data API for bank data retrieval
